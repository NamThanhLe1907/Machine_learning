This file is a part of my journey to learn Machine Learning, specifically Neural Networks.
I will be using this file to implement a small-scale neural network from scratch.
The goal is to understand the basic concepts of neural networks, including forward propagation,
backward propagation, and how to train a model using gradient descent.
